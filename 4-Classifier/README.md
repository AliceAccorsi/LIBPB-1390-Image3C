This folder contains notebooks that show how to use the classifier part of image3c. The order to run the notebooks is:
1) [Image Preprocessing](image_preprocessing.ipynb)
2) [Training](training_the_classifier.ipynb)
3) [Performance testing](performance_testing.ipynb)
4) [Predicting a new dataset](predict_new_dataset.ipynb)

To obtain the notebooks, this git repository can be cloned:
```git clone git@github.com:stowersinstitute/LIBPB-1390-Image3C.git```

or by downloading zip files containing the notebooks from the Stowers Original Data Repository.

A zip file with just the notebooks can be downloaded from:

The notebooks used in the example notebooks can be found on the original data ftp for the paper:

[Classifier Notebooks](https://www.stowers.org/research/publications/odr)

The notebooks and all of the data used in the classifier example can be downloaded here (3.3 GB):
